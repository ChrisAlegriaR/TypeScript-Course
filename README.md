# 🔷 TypeScript Course  

## 📖 Course, Examples and Concepts Description  
This repository is composed of one part:

1. **TypeScript Course**:  
   In the **`course/`** folder, you will find my personal notes on the fundamental and structured concepts of TypeScript that I learned in the **SergieCode** course. This course provides the essential knowledge needed to understand and practice static typing in JavaScript environments, including detailed explanations about data types, union types, interfaces, type aliases, classes, generics, encapsulation, parameter properties, watch mode, compilation process, and object-oriented programming principles applied in TypeScript.

### ⚖️ Use of Non-Owned Content  
In all parts of this repository (course, examples, and concepts), **multimedia resources** (such as images, icons, or conceptual references) that are not my own work have been used. These resources belong to their respective creators and companies. They are used exclusively for educational purposes, within the context of the course, and **are not for commercial use**. All copyright over the visual, audio, and video content belongs to the respective original creators.

### 🔑 Educational Purpose  
The main goal of this repository is to learn and practice TypeScript, as well as to apply static typing and object-oriented programming principles in modern development environments. Any multimedia resources used are **purely educational** and **non-commercial**. Throughout the development of this course, I have implemented **my own work**, such as detailed comments in the code and structured explanations to strengthen the learning process.

### ⚠️ Important  
The **code** in this repository is **my own work**, written and adapted by me during the course development. The only elements that do not belong to me are the multimedia resources (images, icons, or conceptual references), which have been used exclusively for educational purposes, always respecting the copyright of the original creators.  

- The **course** includes examples and resources taken for educational purposes, respecting the copyright of the original creators.  
- The **TypeScript examples** were created with the same purpose: to practice what I learned in the **SergieCode** course.

💻 *This course was made for educational purposes, based on the **SergieCode** course, and with the goal of learning and practicing TypeScript.*  

## 🏆 Acknowledgments and Mentions  
I would like to express my deepest gratitude to teacher `©SergieCode` for his invaluable contribution to my learning in the TypeScript course. Thanks to his clear explanations, practical approach, and generosity in sharing his knowledge, this project has become possible. His dedication and effort have been essential to expanding my horizons and taking my learning to a higher level. I deeply thank him for being such an inspiring and committed instructor.

I also want to extend my deepest recognition to the creators of the multimedia resources used in this course. The **visual**, **audio**, and **data** content belongs to their respective authors and companies, and without their material, this project would not have been able to reach the quality and clarity it presents today. I am very grateful for the work and dedication they have put into creating these resources. I apologize for any inconvenience, and with the utmost respect, I thank them for allowing us to access them for educational purposes. I have made sure to select the highest-quality resources to honor their efforts and dedication.

## 🗣️ Project Language  
All the content in this repository, both in the **examples** and the **course**, is in **Spanish**. I have chosen to keep the content in this language because it is a **personal** project, and it is easier for me to understand and organize the information in Spanish. This choice has allowed me to work more efficiently and in greater detail in the comments and code structure. **Only the repository description and this README will be in English**, to ensure that it is accessible to a wider audience, while maintaining a clear and understandable educational focus.
